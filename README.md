# NYTGames solver site
A react app to host the nyt game solvers I've made 

## Process
I started by importing the logos that I would use downloaded from icons8, and created a favicon us favicon generator which also provided the manifest. Next was creating the home page I want the website to emulate the NYT Games page so I'll be copying its design I began with the header. I created a theme file to store all colours and font styling and later on I can use this for a light and dark mode. I have some previous experience with MUI so I chose to create a theme using it. I actually began with the cards which the CSS for was alot of trial and error as not everything could be copied from the website.
